          You’ve probably seen many references to HTML5, along with <br>  “Deprecated” or “New” in HTML5. This can sometimes be confusing, as you find out that the way you <br/>
          thought you were “supposed” to do something is now not the right way
          at all. <br /><br />
          It can also be annoying — especially since most of these “deprecated
          features” still work on <br />
          most browsers. Why bother learning a new way of doing something if
          the old way works just fine? <br /><br />
          And, of course, it can be difficult to find the right information
          sometimes. Content on the internet <br />
          doesn’t live forever… but almost. And the older content is, the more
          likely it is that you’ll
          <a href="#">find it on a <br />
            search engine</a>. (All things being equal, Google and the others prefer older
          content. Also, older content <br />
          has had more time to acquire backlinks.) This means that you will
          often find out-of-date tutorials when <br />
          you are looking for information about HTML. <br /><br />
          This article should clear up some of that confusion and get you on
          the right track with modern web <br />
          development.

          <p>
            <i>(Skip ahead to What is HTML5 if you are already familiar with
              HTML generally.)</i>
          </p>

          <p>
            You probably already know that HTML, or HyperText Markup Language,
            is the language used for <br />
            web documents. It is not a programming language, but rather a
            language that identifies the <br />
            meaning, purpose, and structure of text within a document.
          </p>

          <p>For example, consider this document:</p>
        </div>


        <!-- this is container 2 -->


        <div class="container-1">
          <h1>All About Rats</h1>
          <h2>Why Do Rats Make Great Pets?</h2>
          <p>
            Forget what you’ve learned from horror films, rats make great pets
            — especially for children. <br />
            And unlike the popular hamster, they almost never bite.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            You can easily understand the structure of the document because it
            is simple, and you are an <br />
            intelligent human being who has read many documents in your life.
            But your web browser needs to <br />
            understand the document in order to present it to you in an
            intelligent and meaningful way. So we <br />
            use HTML tags (also called “elements”) to identify the different
            pieces of the document. <br />
            <br />
            For this simple document, we can add an <code> < h1> </code> tag to
            identify the main heading for the page (the title <br />
            of the document), and <code> < /h1 > </code> to close it. Use the
            <code> < h2 > </h2> </code> tag to identify the first headline within the
            <br />
            content, and a <code> < /h2 > </code> tag to identify the block of
            content following it as a paragraph.
          </p>
        </div>



        <!-- this is container 3 -->

        <div class="container">
          <p> <code> < h1> </code> All About Rats <code>< /h1> </code> <br>
            <code> < h2> </code> Why Do Rats Make Great Pets? <code>< /h2> </code> <br> Forget what you've learned from
            horror films, rats make great pets -- <br> especially for children. And unlike the popular hamster, they
            almost never bite.
          </p>


        </div>



        <div>
          <p>
            Now, a web browser can show you this document in a more meaningful way. This might seem trivial <br> for a
            short document with one headline a single paragraph, but it can get complicated very fast. You’ve <br> seen
            a lot of web pages, so you know that there are all sorts of things (not just headlines and <br> paragraphs)
            that people need to represent on their web pages. Things like:
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- this section about unorder list -->


        <ul>

          <li><a href="#">Form</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Lists</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Links to other pages</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Media</a></li>
        </ul>


        <div>
          <p>
            And that’s just for starters. You also need to be able to identify <a href="#">sections of your document</a>
            and provide <br>
            <a href="#">metadata about the document itself</a>. (Metadata is information about the document, such as the
            title, <br> author,
            relevant keywords, and relationship to other documents.)
          </p>
        </div>


        <div>
          <h1>
            HTML History and Development
          </h1>
          <p>HTML has been around for a long time. Its roots go back to at least 1980, with <a href="#">Tim Berners-Lee</a> ‘s <br> project
            <a href="#">ENQUIRE</a>. And actually, the  concept of <a href="#">hypertext</a> goes back even further than that. The <br> concept first appeared
            in the early 1940s, and was named and demonstrated in the 1960s. <br><br>

            In 1989, Lee proposed a new hypertext system based on the ideas of ENQUIRE (and other systems, <br> such as
           <a href="#">Apple’s HyperCard</a> ). This became the first version of what we now call HTML. <br><br>

            Since then, the language has been in constant development. The specification is managed by the <br> <a href="#">World Wide
              Web Consortium</a> (Berners-Lee is still the director, as of 2018), and the <a href="#"> Web Hypertext <br>  Application Technology
                Working Group</a>. (So, if you don’t like HTML5, these are the people to blame.) <br><br>

            The language has evolved over all this time because web development has changed. We do things with <br> web pages
            and HTML today that were never dreamt of by the early developers and implementers  of <br> the language. A web
            page is no longer just a document; it is likely to be a full-scale web application. <br> And even when it is
            “just a document,” we want search engines and other tools to understand the  <br> content of the website. We
            aren’t just creating pages for human readers anymore, but for artificially- <br> intelligent systems that collect
            and manipulate information. <br><br>

            Why did HTML have to change? Because the web has changed.</p>
